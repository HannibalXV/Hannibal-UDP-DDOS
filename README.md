# Hannibal-UDP-DDOS
# Summary:
This code is a simple UDP (User Datagram Protocol) based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack tool. It allows users to specify a target URL, the number of threads (concurrent connections) to create, and then sends a flood of random UDP packets to the target.
# requirements
python -c "import socket, threading"

# Usage:
To use this code, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. This code relies on the socket and threading modules, which are part of the Python standard library.

Copy and paste the code into a Python script.

Run the script.

Enter the target URL when prompted. You can include the "https://" prefix or omit it.

Enter the number of threads (concurrent connections) you want to create for the DDoS attack.

The code will display information about the attack, such as the protocol (UDP), the target IP, and the target port (80 by default).

The attack will start, with each thread continuously sending random UDP packets to the target IP and port.

To stop the attack, press Ctrl+C to raise a KeyboardInterrupt exception and exit the script.
